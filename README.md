# Assignment 7 - Bhavya Pandey 
The **[`a7.ipynb`](https://github.com/macs30113-s23/a7-bhavyapan/blob/main/a7.ipynb)** Jupyter Notebook carries out an EDA on the NYC TLC Trips data, with special emphasis on the tips amount paid by riders through the year 2019.
This complete dataset has close to 80 million rows of observations, and hence classifies as a representative big data. 
Further, it is also worth noting that querying such large data runs into memory and other bottlenecks given the constraints of scalability, which was observed while creating the required plots using the data, and addressed in a manner similar to the one discussed in class where a representative sample of the data was used for the analysis.

The Notebook has the following features:
* An introduction to the rationale behind considering this particular line of questioning for carrying out the EDA, and the scope for further modelling, and predictions that can be carried out using the data.
* 5 vizualizations using the data, which can be run using a PySpark kernel on an EMR cluster, and 5 corresponding descriptions for each of these vizualizations that explain the observations in question.
* A concluding remark regarding scalability and addressal of the assignment questions.
